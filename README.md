# Graphics-Project
Utilizing the attained knowledge on graphics to build a meaninful video game.

Current Status:
Main scene(currently a blank scene)
Space Scene (in progress)
Empty Scene
Empty Scene
Platforms created for use (in Sprites Folder)

Things that need to be done:

- We are going to have a total of three scenes in which the user will be able to choose from one of which is a space scene which is what I'm currently doing. It will be up to you as to what type of scene you will choose. 

- Each scene needs to have a score tracker, a retry option if the character falls off the platform or gets burned or frozen, and a option to return to the main scene if they decide to choose a different scene. Also most importantly we want to have each scene contain the high score(other than the main scene).

- Characters( should be relevant to the scene of course)

- Audio
